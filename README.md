# top50_instagrammers
A script for cleaning and summarizing data from a table of top instagram users in the world, generating visualizations from plotly

This python code makes use of the pandas module for cleaning and summarizing the data, and the plotly module for generating automatic plots with a repeating structure. The data source used is a .csv file downloaded from the online repository: kaggle.com
